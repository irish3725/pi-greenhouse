pi-greenhouse is raspberry pi controlled greenhouse with a webpage front end to display the current conditions as well as a history of the conditions in the greenhouse. 

The intention of this project is to combine my passion for house plants and my passion for software development. I get to gain experience with automation, web development, database management, and plant propogation at the same time.
